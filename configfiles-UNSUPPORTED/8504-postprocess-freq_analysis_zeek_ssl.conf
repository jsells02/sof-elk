    # freq.py and the corresponding frequency table in /opt/freq/.  This is a huge boost to security
    # and I highly recommend you set this up.  Example, if a frequency score less than 6 exists
    # then there is a likelihood that something malicious is happening.
    #
    # For higher accuracy, please generate your own frequency tables.  For questions on setup,
